 * Grid Search
 *
 * You've been given a grid of dimensions M x N. This grid is special though. There are some rules for numbers
 * in this grid.
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><code>grid[i][j] > grid[i][j-1]</code> for <code>0 < j < N </code></li>
 *   <li><code>grid[i][j] > grid[i-1][j]</code> for <code>0 < i < M </code></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>You must find if a given number exists in this grid at all.</p>
 * <p>Oh, and this grid can be really huge, so optimize your execution speed.</p>
